# **Geo Location API**

#### Calculates distance between two points.

This API offers three ways of calculating the distance between two points on the surface of the Earth.

##### Calculate Distance Haversine

**According to Wikipedia:** "The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles."

##### Calculate Distance Spherical Law Of Cosines

**According to Wikipedia:** In spherical trigonometry, the law of cosines (also called the cosine rule for sides) is a theorem relating the sides and angles of spherical triangles, analogous to the ordinary law of cosines from plane trigonometry.

Formula: {\displaystyle \cos C=-\cos A\cos B+\sin A\sin B\cos c\,}
